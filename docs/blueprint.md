- Accent color: A muted green (#81C784), will serve as a secondary highlight, appearing in the navigation or for success confirmations.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, universally recognizable icons from a set like Material Design Icons for item categories and actions.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure elements are consistently aligned and spaced, optimizing for readability and ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle transitions to provide feedback, improve perceived performance, and guide users through the app.
